# Electric Minibus Project
# Overview

This project details the complete process of building an electric minibus from scratch, designed to demonstrate my expertise in electric vehicle technology and innovation. The minibus, capable of carrying over six passengers, uses components repurposed from an electric scooter, including four 48V brushless DC motors and their controllers.

# Technical Details

Motors and Controllers:

I installed four 48V brushless DC motors with matching controllers from an electric scooter. To create a unified control system, I combined the motor throttles to function as a single accelerator pedal, giving seamless speed control and efficient energy use.

# Battery System:

The battery packs are connected in parallel to ensure balanced power distribution across all motors, optimizing the vehicle’s range and performance.
Capacity and Performance

The minibus has a passenger capacity of six, making it ideal for urban and short-distance routes. This model highlights both functionality and efficiency, showcasing my skills in vehicle assembly, wiring, and controller integration.
